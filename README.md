# Homeowners Association Helper - CS 3365 - Fall 2024

## Product Vision

The **Homeowners Association (HOA) Helper** is a web application designed to assist neighbors administering a homeowners association (HOA). It simplifies tracking monthly payments, understanding payment status (who is up-to-date, who is delayed, and what amount is due), sending payment reminders, and generating monthly statements. It also alerts the HOA board for review to ensure proper funding.

Unlike other services, our HOA helper provides a real-time view of payment statuses for both property owners and administration, helping all involved parties stay reminded of upcoming or overdue payments.

This web application uses **TypeScript** and is deployed on **Vercel**. The backend relies on **Prisma ORM** and a **Prisma Postgres** database, powered by Prisma.

For more details, refer to the Prisma Postgres documentation: [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/prisma-postgres).
